## Prerequisites

First and foremost, here's the docs:

> https://steamcommunity.com/dev

Now that we have that out of the way, there are two things that you need:

1. A [SteamId](#how-do-i-find-my-steamid)
2. A [Steam API Key](#how-do-i-find-my-steam-api-key)

See below for instruction for each of these

### How do I find my SteamId?

Login to Steam on the web or in the desktop app.

Go to the upper-right corner and click on

`[Your Username] -> Account Details`

In the header, under "[Username]'s Account", you'll find your 17 Digit SteamId that looks like this:

`SteamdID: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX`

### How do I find my Steam API Key?

you can visit the [Steam API Key Dashboard](https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey) to register a new API key.

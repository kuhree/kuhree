Mostly, living life is pretty cool. Sometimes it kinda sucks.

This is a personal reminder on how to fix that.

## Recognizing ~Burnout~ ~Depression~ ~when I don't feel quite right~ when I'm living shitty

When I have to convince myself to [insert-loved-activity-since-childhood]. I don't mean the casual "if I want to live I have to work" conversation I have with myself every Monday. I'm talking about the more existential crisis-like "I've always loved X, why do I feel like I hate it now" way of existing.

Google/Brave Search says that burnout is

> a state of emotional, mental, and often physical exhaustion brought on by prolonged or repeated stress

and... sure that's close

Depression is

> Depression is a mood disorder that causes a persistent feeling of sadness and loss of interest and can interfere with your daily functioning.

ehh, not quite right

To be clear, I've never been diagnosed with anything here.

I just know that something the little things of every day life are 10x harder and the harder things 100x.

It kinda sucks. It sucks for me, for you, for family, friends, teams.

It's not pretty, but it happens.

## My solution

Literally, go outside.

Outside of the house, outside of your routine, outside of your comfort zone.

Go do something you've never done before. Make a new memory. Make 5, 10.

Focus on new habits. Learn a new skill.

Get lost in the city you've lived in for years. Take a picture to remember the spot.

Remember that life is long. You're gonna get the ups and downs, but ... you get the rest.

Just keep living, stay curious, have fun with it. You'll be alright.

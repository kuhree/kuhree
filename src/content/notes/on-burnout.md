## Introduction 

## Recognizing Burnout

I define being burned out when I have to convince myself to code (even more than usual). I don't mean the casual "if I want to live I have to work" every Monday in the shower. I'm talking about the more existential crisis-coded "I've always loved coding, why do I feel like I hate it now" way of existing.

You can replace computer with tech/learning/cars or whatever you're thinking of.

Google/Brave Search (same thing) says that burnout is

> a state of emotional, mental, and often physical exhaustion brought on by prolonged or repeated stress

and... yea that tracks for me.

## The Experience of Burnout

Being burned out doesn't feel good. It makes the little things of every day work 10x harder and the harder things 100x. It kinda sucks. It hurts you, your team, and everyone else up and down the org chart. It's not pretty, but it happens.

It starts slowly with the Monday Blues, the Hump-day Hiccups, and waiting for the weekend.

## Root Causes of Burnout

I lose my grounding and end up focusing 100% on whatever I'm working on with very little regard for the world outside of it. I lose myself in the process and find myself lost when I inevitably have to move on.

## Coping with Burnout

Literally, go outside.

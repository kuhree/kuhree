Hi, I'm Khari Johnson, a Software Engineer with a passion for

- exploring the limits of technology
- utilizing those limits to increase human wellness
- automating all the things along the way

Throughout my journey, I have been involved in projects such as:

- [Time Machine][time-machine] - A simple, non-addictive app that brings hope into people's lives.
- [The Qube][theqube] - Discover the best music & podcasts by BIPOC & QTPOC creators

Where I worked on:

- Backend architcture, implementation, and orchestration
- Frontend implementation, testing, and performance
- System Design, Workflows, Support

If you would like to get in touch with me for professional or personal matters,
feel free to view my [resume][] and contact me directly.

I live and work in Austin, Texas (but I'm moving soon!).

In the past, I've also dabbled in...

- sales (great money, lots of connections)
- photography (only as a hobby these days)
- marketing (I _really_ hate PPC ads and how they "track" you around the web)
- electrician's apprentice (would love to continue)

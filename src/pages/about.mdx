Hey, I'm Khari.

I love to build things that solve problems while
collaborating with others for the same or similar goals.

Currently, this means developing software that aims to better the
lives of those around me.

I'm currently working on [Time Machine](time-machine) and [The Qube](theqube) --
two projects that aim to serve the communities in which they were founded.

In the past, I've also dabbled in...

- photography (only for fun these days)
- marketing (I _really_ hate PPC ads)
- apprentice electrician (would love to continue)

If I had to describe myself in a few words...

- Maker/Builder/Tinkerer/Explorer
- \*Nix Enthusiast
- Privacy and Self-Host Advocate

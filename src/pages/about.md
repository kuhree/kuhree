Hey!

I'm a curious adventurer with a passion for making things that help people.

My journey started and continues to revolve around a love for all things \*Nix.

I'm currently working on [Time Machine](time-machine) and [The Qube](theqube) --
two projects that aim to serve the communities in which they were founded.

In the past, I've also dabbled in...

- sales (great money)
- photography (only for fun these days)
- marketing (I _really_ hate PPC ads)
- electrician's apprentice (would love to continue)

If I had to describe myself...

- Maker/Builder/Tinkerer/Explorer
- Privacy Enthusiast

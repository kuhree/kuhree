Hi there!

I'm a curious adventurer with a passion for making and all things \*Nix.

My never-ending curiosity has taken me on many exciting journeys, both physical and mental.
I'm always eager to explore new ideas and techniques in the maker world, constantly seeking to improve my skills and abilities.
When I'm not tinkering with tech, you'll likely find me out on some wild adventure or soaking up the beauty of nature.
If you're looking for someone who loves to create, explore, and challenge the norm, let's connect!

I'm currently working on [Time Machine](time-machine) and [The Qube](theqube) --
two projects that aim to serve the communities in which they were founded.

In the past, I've also dabbled in...

- sales (great money, but can suck your soul)
- photography (only for fun these days)
- marketing (I _really_ hate PPC ads)
- apprentice electrician (would love to continue)

If I had to describe myself in a few words...

- Maker/Builder/Tinkerer/Explorer
- \*Nix Enthusiast w/ a focus on Privacy and Self-Hostability

Professionally, I build web apps that can grow without breaking. I enjoy digging into the messy tech problems and finding ways to keep everything humming along.
I generally use the JavaScript/TypeScript ecosystem and cloud technologies while helping out teammates and pitching in to make the business goals happen.

- **Frontend:** [JavaScript][js]/[TypeScript][ts], [React][react]
- **Backend:** [Node.js][node], [Go][go]
- **Databases:** [SQLite][sqlite], [Postgres][postgres]
- **CI:** [Docker][docker], [GitHub Actions][gh-actions]
- **Hosting:** [Cloudflare][cloudflare], `[insert cloud provider]`

Personally, often exploring...

- **More Tech:**
  - [Gaming][steam] and hardware
  - Privacy and self-hosting FOSS
- **Art:**
  - [Photography][gallery]
  - [TV/Movies/Stories][trakt]
- **Mechanical things:**
  - Keyboards
  - Bikes/Drones

## Currently Working On

- Solving problems at `[work]`
- Building [terminal games in Go][gg]
- Making GC in [Rocket League][rocket-league]
